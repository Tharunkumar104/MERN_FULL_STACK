        </div>
        <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni, born July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, is widely celebrated as one of cricket’s greatest
            leaders
            and
            finishers. He made his international debut in 2004 and quickly became a sensation with his
            aggressive
            batting
            and sharp
            wicketkeeping, famously scoring 148 against Pakistan early in his career. Dhoni’s captaincy,
            beginning
            in
            2007,
            marked a
            golden era for Indian cricket: he led India to victory in all three major ICC tournaments—the 2007
            T20
            World
            Cup, the
            2011 ODI World Cup (where his unbeaten 91 in the final remains iconic), and the 2013 Champions
            Trophy—making
            him
            the
            only captain to achieve this feat. Under his leadership, India also topped the ICC Test rankings for
            the
            first
            time in
            2009, and he became the Indian captain with the most Test wins. Known for his cool temperament and
            tactical
            brilliance,
            Dhoni scored 17,266 international runs, including 16 centuries and 108 half-centuries, and remains
            the
            only
            wicketkeeper
            to surpass 10,000 ODI runs with an average above 50. As a wicketkeeper, he set records for most
            dismissals
            and
            stumpings
            in international cricket, with 195 stumpings and 829 dismissals across formats. In the IPL, Dhoni is
            synonymous
            with the
            Chennai Super Kings, leading them to five titles and ten finals in 14 seasons, and holding records
            for
            most
            matches and
            wins as captain. Even after retiring from international cricket in 2020, Dhoni’s influence endures,
            both
            as
            a
            player and
            as a mentor, and he was recently inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame, cementing his legacy as one of
            the
            sport’s
            all-time
            greats.Dhoni’s rise in cricket was marked by his debut for India in 2004 and his rapid ascent as a
            dynamic
            wicketkeeper-batsman. Known for his unorthodox batting style and the famous "helicopter shot," Dhoni
            became
            a
            match-finisher par excellence. His calm and tactical leadership earned him the captaincy of the
            Indian
            limited-overs
            team in 2007 and the Test team in 2008. Under his captaincy, India won all three major ICC trophies:
            the
            2007
            ICC World
            Twenty20, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, a unique feat in
            cricket
            history.
            He also
            led India to the top of the ICC Test rankings for the first time in 2009. Dhoni’s leadership style,
            often
            described as
            "Captain Cool," combined with his sharp cricketing acumen, helped India achieve remarkable success
            across
            formats. In
            the Indian Premier League, he has been the cornerstone of Chennai Super Kings, leading the franchise
            to
            five
            IPL
            titles
            and becoming the most successful captain in the tournament’s history.On the personal front, Dhoni
            married Sakshi Singh
            Rawat on July 4, 2010, after a few years of
            courtship.
            Sakshi,
            originally from Assam and a hotel management graduate, has been a constant pillar of support, often
            seen
            cheering Dhoni
            during IPL matches. The couple has a daughter named Ziva, born in February 2015, who has garnered a
            significant
            following on social media. Dhoni’s dedication to cricket was evident when he chose to continue
            playing
            in
            the
            2015 World
            Cup despite the birth of his daughter, citing national duty as his priority. Beyond cricket, Dhoni
            is
            admired
            for his
            humility, resilience, and strong family values, which have endeared him to millions. His journey
            from a
            small-town boy
            to a global cricketing legend remains an inspiring story of perseverance, talent, and leadership</p>

        <h1 style="display: inline;">Ruturaj Gaikwad</h1>
        <p>Ruturaj Gaikwad, born on January 31, 1997, in Pune, Maharashtra, has rapidly emerged as one of India’s
            most
            promising
            young cricketers. A technically sound right-handed opener, Gaikwad made his first-class debut for
            Maharashtra in
            the
            2016-17 Ranji Trophy and soon established himself as a prolific run-scorer in domestic cricket. He has
            captained
            Maharashtra in both T20 and List A formats, leading by example with consistent performances, including a
            remarkable run
            in the 2021–22 Vijay Hazare Trophy where he scored four centuries and amassed over 600 runs, equalling
            Virat
            Kohli’s
            record for most hundreds in a single season. Gaikwad also made headlines by becoming the first batter to
            hit
            seven sixes
            in an over during the 2022–23 Vijay Hazare Trophy, and he now holds the record for the most centuries in
            the
            tournament’s history
        </p>
        <p>
            Gaikwad’s breakthrough in the Indian Premier League (IPL) came with the Chennai Super Kings (CSK), where
            he
            made
            his
            debut in 2020 and quickly became a key player. In the 2021 season, he won the Orange Cap for scoring the
            most
            runs (635)
            and was named the Emerging Player of the Year as CSK clinched the title. He continued his strong form in
            subsequent IPL
            seasons, helping CSK win their fifth title in 2023. Recognized for his maturity and leadership, Gaikwad
            was
            appointed
            CSK captain in 2024, succeeding MS Dhoni and becoming only the fourth player to lead the franchise. His
            calm
            temperament, consistency, and ability to anchor innings have drawn comparisons to his predecessor.

            On the international stage, Gaikwad debuted for India in T20Is and ODIs after impressive domestic and
            IPL
            performances.
            He has led India’s T20I team to a gold medal at the 2022 Asian Games and scored his maiden international
            century
            (123*)
            in a T20I against Australia in 2023, becoming the first Indian to score a T20I hundred against
            Australia.
            Off
            the field,
            Gaikwad is known for his humble demeanor and dedication, making him a respected figure among teammates
            and
            fans
            alike.
            As both a player and a leader, Ruturaj Gaikwad continues to be seen as a vital part of India’s
            cricketing
            future,
            carrying forward a legacy of excellence and composure similar to that of MS Dhoni.
